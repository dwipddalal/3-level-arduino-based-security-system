# Three level Security System using Arduino
Devised a Treasure hunt game. To get this treasure the player has to pass 3 levels of security. The entire game was made in Thinkercad. The Report.pdf contains detail description
about how to play this game and the rules of the game.

# Background
This was done as part of IIT Gandhinagar's Robotics Club's event. In a competition with 80 models, my team secured second position.
